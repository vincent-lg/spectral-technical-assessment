# TASK

## Language-independent gRPC-based microservice:

- Create a gRPC server (in your preferred language) that serves the time based electricity consumption data found in meterusage.csv
- Using whatever tool you prefer, create a http server that will request the data from the gRPC server and deliver the consumption data as JSON.
- Create a single page html document that requests the JSON from the http server and displays it.

Please supply a link to your work in a public repository and a short README with a description of what you did.
